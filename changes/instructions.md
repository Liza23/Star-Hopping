For running the file, follow following instructions:

1. Download the Hop_sequence (modular).py file in the local computer and run the file normal.
2. On executing the file, two inputs would be required, first for the x coordinate of the click and next for the y coordinate of the click
3. A third input would also be required, which is the input for flag, enter any value if you want to keep giving clicks and if no more clicks are required press enter for that input
4. the values for limit_range = 50, max_range = 50, limiting_brightness = 0.1 have been set as mentioned and if want to modify according to the data this can be done by changing values in line 122.
5. I'm using a sample simple data to test the code which is used in line 125 and can be changed there and stated in lines 109-110 and can be manipulated over there.

For a sample execution refer to the python notebook Hop_sequence (modular).ipynb
